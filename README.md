# JSON Content Generator

This is a generic solution for dynamically generating JSON output. 

It has an ADMIN area where admins can create Menus and Fields and a USER area where owners can fill their own applications with data.

This Web application is composed of 3 parts: 

- Admin: used by the system administrator, to create all the fields the app is going to have, including text, images and dates. 
- Owner: used by the owner of the app so he or she can add contents, using the fields created by the sysadmin. 
- JSON rest service: Used to automatically generate a JSON output, with the contents generated by the owner.
